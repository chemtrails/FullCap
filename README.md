FullCap - Full Page Capture
========================

A simple browser extension that takes a screen capture of a full web page.

Peter Coles created [full-page-screen-capture-chrome-extension](https://github.com/mrcoles/full-page-screen-capture-chrome-extension). The project seems dead and the [chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gofullpage-full-page-scre/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl) is closed source. So I migrated it to Manifest v3 and plan to maintain it here.

### To Install

For development:

1. Clone this repo
2. Open up Chrome and go to the extensions page (Window → Extensions)
3. Enable developer mode (if it’s not already)
4. Click on “Load unpacked extension…”
5. Select the folder for this app

From the webstore:
